# 👋 Hi, I'm Shivam

I'm an engineering student actively building my foundation in programming.  
I've completed my first core course in **C++**, and every project you'll see here is built with that knowledge — from scratch, no fluff.

---

## 🔧 What I Know (So Far)

- **C++** – Core syntax, OOP, functions, loops, classes, STL  
- **Git/GitHub** – Using GitHub Desktop to commit and manage my projects  
- Currently learning:  
  - 🐍 **Python** (logic building, scripting)  
  - 📚 **Data Structures & Algorithms** (early stage)  
  - 🤖 **Intro to Machine Learning** (just started)

---

## 📦 Projects I've Built

> Projects are based on my completed **C++ course** and reflect real effort and learning.

### ⚙️ C++ Fundamentals Series  
Programs covering:
- Classes and Objects  
- Functions and Pointers  
- Loops and Conditionals  
- Basic File Handling

More complex logic-based projects coming soon.

## 📚 Course Completed

- ✅ **Master C++ Programming From Beginner To Advance**  
  Instructor: Codaming – Simplified Learning  
  > All current projects are based on this course.

---

## 🧱 My GitHub Philosophy

- No tutorial copy-pastes  
- Only projects I understand and wrote myself  
- Learning in public — this profile will grow with me
